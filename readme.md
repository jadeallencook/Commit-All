# Push

Git add, commit, and push all in one command

## Installation

Direct your terminal to the "Push" directory and give the installer permissions.

```sh
  chmod +x install.sh
```

And then run the installer.

```sh
  ./install.sh
```

That will make a copy of the push.sh file and move it to your /usr/local/bin.

## How To Use

Here's an example of how to push all changes to GitHub.

```sh
push.sh . "my message"
```
